:Document last updated: |today|

   Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part
   of the observed -- merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group
   experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion,
   philosophy, and science -- it means as little to us (because we are from
   Earth) as color means to a blind man.
   
    -- `From "Stranger in a Strange Land" by Robert A. Heinlein.`
        
This is the Grok reference documentation. It is organized by the Python
artefacts that implement it's concepts.

Grok makes Zope 3 concepts more accessible for application developers. This
reference is not intended as introductory material for those concepts. Please
refer to the original Zope 3 documentation and the other introductory material within this Official Grok Documentation site.
